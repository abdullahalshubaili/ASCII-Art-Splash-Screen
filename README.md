Automatically presents ASCII art to you when you open terminal and changes "Randomly"

## How to get this working


This tutorial is for unix based systems #Sorry Windows. 
Also if you need this tutorial you probably shouldn't be using terminal.

 1. Download the `ascii.py` file and install it at your home directory. 
 2. Open Terminal 
 3. Type `cd` to ensure you're at the home directory
 4. Type `nano .bash_profile` (Vim is a prefered editor, nano is just easy to use.)
 5. Use arrow keys to add at the bottom `python3 ascii.py`
 6. Exit nano by pressing `Ctrl + x` then `y` then `<Enter Key>`
 7. Restart Terminal
 
 ## Support
 This repo is not being supported anymore as all of the functionality desired has been implemented.
